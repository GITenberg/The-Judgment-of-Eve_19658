<div class="chapter" id="Chapter_I">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page1" name="page1"></a>1</span>I</h2>
<p>It was market-day in Queningford.
Aggie Purcell was wondering whether
Mr. Hurst would look in that afternoon
at the Laurels as he had looked
in on other market-days. Supposing
he did, and supposing Mr. Gatty were
to look in, too, why then, Aggie said,
it would be rather awkward. But
whether awkward for herself, or for
Mr. Gatty, or Mr. Hurst, or for all three
of them together, Aggie was unable to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2"></a>2</span>explain to her own satisfaction or her
mother&#8217;s.</p>

<p>In Queningford there were not many
suitors for a young lady to choose from,
but it was understood that, such as
there were, Aggie Purcell would have
her pick of them. The other young
ladies were happy enough if they
could get her leavings. Miss Purcell
of the Laurels was by common consent
the prettiest, the best-dressed, and
the best-mannered of them all. To be
sure, she could only be judged by
Queningford standards; and, as the
railway nearest to Queningford is a
terminus that leaves the small gray
town stranded on the borders of the
unknown, Queningford standards are
not progressive. Neither are they imitative;
for imitation implies a certain
nearness, and between the young
ladies of Queningford and the daughters
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3" name="page3"></a>3</span>of the county there is an immeasurable
void.</p>

<p>The absence of any effective rivalry
made courtship a rather tame and uninteresting
affair to Miss Purcell. She
had only to make up her mind whether
she would take the wine-merchant&#8217;s
son, or the lawyer&#8217;s nephew, or the
doctor&#8217;s assistant, or, perhaps, it would
be one of those mysterious enthusiasts
who sometimes came into the neighborhood
to study agriculture. Anyhow,
it was a foregone conclusion that
each of these doomed young men must
pass through Miss Purcell&#8217;s door before
he knocked at any other.</p>

<p>Pretty Aggie was rather a long time
in making up her mind. It could only
be done by a slow process of elimination,
till the embarrassing train of her
adorers was finally reduced to two.
At the age of five-and-twenty (five-and-twenty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>4</span>is not young in Queningford),
she had only to solve the comparatively
simple problem: whether
it would be Mr. John Hurst or Mr.
Arthur Gatty. Mr. John Hurst was
a young farmer just home from Australia,
who had bought High Farm,
one of the biggest sheep-farming lands
in the Cotswolds. Mr. Arthur Gatty
was a young clerk in a solicitor&#8217;s office
in London; he was down at Queningford
on his Easter holiday, staying
with cousins at the County Bank.
Both had the merit of being young
men whom Miss Purcell had never
seen before. She was so tired of all
the young men whom she had seen.</p>

<p>Not that pretty Aggie was a flirt
and a jilt and a heartless breaker of
hearts. She wouldn&#8217;t have broken
anybody&#8217;s heart for the whole world;
it would have hurt her own too much.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>5</span>She had never jilted anybody, because
she had never permitted herself to
become engaged to any of those young
men. As for flirting, pretty Aggie
couldn&#8217;t have flirted if she had tried.
The manners of Queningford are not
cultivated to that delicate pitch when
flirtation becomes a decorative art,
and Aggie would have esteemed it
vulgar. But Aggie was very superior
and fastidious. She wanted things
that no young man in Queningford
would ever be able to offer her. Aggie
had longings for music, better than
Queningford&#8217;s best, for beautiful pictures,
and for poetry. She had come
across these things at school. And
now, at five-and-twenty, she couldn&#8217;t
procure one of them for herself. The
arts were not encouraged by her family,
and she only had an &#8220;allowance&#8221; on
condition that she would spend it honorably
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>6</span>in clothes. Of course, at five-and-twenty,
she knew all the &#8220;pieces&#8221;
and songs that her friends knew, and
they knew all hers. She had read all
the romantic fiction in the lending
library, and all the works of light
popular science, and still lighter and
more popular theology, besides borrowing
all the readable books from the
vicarage. She had exhausted Queningford.
It had no more to give her.</p>

<p>Queningford would have considered
that a young lady who could do all
that had done enough to prove her
possession of brains. Not that Queningford
had ever wanted her to prove
it; its young men, at any rate, very
much preferred that she should leave
her brains and theirs alone. And
Aggie had brains enough to be aware
of this; and being a very well-behaved
young lady, and anxious to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>7</span>please, she had never mentioned any
of her small achievements. Nature,
safeguarding her own interests, had
whispered to Aggie that young ladies
who live in Queningford are better
without intellects that show.</p>

<p>Now, John Hurst was sadly akin to
the young men of Queningford, in that
he was unable to offer her any of the
things which, Aggie felt, belonged to
the finer part of her that she dared
not show. On the other hand, he
could give her (beside himself), a good
income, a good house, a horse to ride,
and a trap to drive in. To marry
him, as her mother pointed out to her,
would be almost as good as &#8220;getting
in with the county.&#8221; Not that Mrs.
Purcell offered this as an inducement.
She merely threw it out as a vague
contribution to the subject. Aggie
didn&#8217;t care a rap about the county,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>8</span>as her mother might have known; but,
though she wouldn&#8217;t have owned it,
she had been attracted by John&#8217;s personal
appearance. Glancing out of the
parlor window, she could see what a
gentleman he looked as he crossed the
market-place in his tweed suit, cloth
cap, and leather gaiters. He always
had the right clothes. When high collars
were the fashion, he wore them
very high. His rivals said that this
superstitious reverence for fashion suggested
a revulsion from a past of prehistoric
savagery.</p>

<p>Mr. Gatty, on the other hand, had
a soul that was higher than any collar.
That, Aggie maintained, was why he
always wore the wrong sort. There
was no wrong thing Mr. Gatty could
have worn that Aggie would not have
found an excuse for; so assiduously
did he minister to the finer part of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>9</span>her. He shared all her tastes. If she
admired a picture or a piece of music
or a book, Mr. Gatty had admired it
ever since he was old enough to admire
anything. She was sure that he admired
her more for admiring them.
She wasn&#8217;t obliged to hide those things
from Mr. Gatty; besides, what would
have been the use? There was nothing
in the soul of Aggie that Mr.
Gatty had not found out and understood,
and she felt that there would
be no limit to his understanding.</p>

<p>But what she liked best about him
was his gentleness. She had never
seen any young man so gentle as Mr.
Gatty.</p>

<p>And his face was every bit as nice
as John&#8217;s. Nicer, for it was excessively
refined, and John&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t.
You could see that his head was full
of beautiful thoughts, whereas John&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>10</span>head was full of nothing in particular.
Then, Mr. Gatty&#8217;s eyes were large and
spiritual; yes, spiritual was the word
for them. John&#8217;s eyes were small,
and, well, spiritual would never be the
word for <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, John had been on the
field first, before the unique appearance
of Mr. Gatty, and Aggie felt that she
was bound in honor to consider him.
She had been considering him for some
time without any compulsion. But
when things began to look so serious
that it really became a question which
of these two she would take, she called
in her mother to help her to decide.</p>

<p>Mrs. Purcell was a comfortable, fat
lady, who loved the state of peace she
had been born in, had married into,
and had never lost. Aggie was her
eldest daughter, and she was a little
vexed to think that she might have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>11</span>married five years ago if she hadn&#8217;t
been so particular. Meanwhile, what
with her prettiness and her superiority,
she was spoiling her younger sisters&#8217;
chances. None of her rejected suitors
had ever turned to Kate or Susie or
Eliza. They were well enough, poor
girls, but as long as Aggie was there
they couldn&#8217;t help looking plain. But
as for deciding between John Hurst
and Mr. Gatty, Mrs. Purcell couldn&#8217;t
do it. And when Aggie said, in her
solemn way, &#8220;Mother, I think it&#8217;s
coming; and I don&#8217;t know how to
choose between them,&#8221; her mother
had nothing to say but:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must use your own judgment,
my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My own judgment? I wonder if
I really have any? You see, I feel
as if I liked them both about the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>12</span>&#8220;Then just say to yourself that if
you marry John Hurst you&#8217;ll have a
big house in the country, and if you
marry Mr. Gatty you&#8217;ll have a little
one in town, and choose between the
houses. That&#8217;ll be easy enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Secretly, Mrs. Purcell was all for
John Hurst, though he couldn&#8217;t be
considered as exactly Aggie&#8217;s equal in
station. (They were always saying
how like a gentleman he looked, which
showed that that was the last thing
they had expected of him. But in
Queningford one does as best one can.)
For all John&#8217;s merits, she was not
going to force him on Aggie in as many
words. Mrs. Purcell deeply desired
her daughter&#8217;s happiness, and she said
to herself: &#8220;If Aggie marries either
of them, and it turns out unhappily,
I don&#8217;t want her to be able to say I
over-persuaded her. If her poor father
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>13</span>were alive, <em>he</em>&#8216;d have known how to
advise her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, all of a sudden, without anybody&#8217;s
advice, John was eliminated,
too. It was not Aggie&#8217;s doing. In
fact, he may be said to have eliminated
himself. It happened in this way:</p>

<p>Mr. Hurst had been taking tea with
Aggie one market-day. The others
were all out, and he had the field to
himself. She always remembered just
how he looked when he did it. He
was standing on the white mohair
rag in the drawing-room, and was
running his fingers through his hair
for the third time. He had been telling
her how he had first taken up
sheep-farming in Australia, how he&#8217;d
been a farm-hand before that in California,
how he&#8217;d always set his mind
on that one thing&#8212;sheep-farming&#8212;because
he had been born and bred
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name="page14"></a>14</span>in the Cotswolds. Aggie&#8217;s dark-blue
eyes were fixed on him, serious and
intent. That flattered him, and the
gods, for his undoing, dowered him
with a disastrous fluency.</p>

<p>He had a way of thrusting out his
jaw when he talked, and Aggie noted
the singular determination of his chin.
It was so powerful as to be almost
brutal. (The same could certainly not
be said of Mr. Gatty&#8217;s.)</p>

<p>Then, in the light of his reminiscences,
a dreadful thought came to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;John,&#8221; she said, suddenly, &#8220;did
you ever kill a pig?&#8221;</p>


<div class="illo" id="illo_2">
<img src="images/illo_2.jpg" width="446" height="547" alt="A seated woman talks to a standing man." />
<p class="illo_caption">&#8220;&#8216;John,&#8217; she said, suddenly, &#8216;did you ever kill a pig?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>He answered, absently, as was his
way when directly addressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;A pig? Yes, I&#8217;ve killed one or
two in California.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew back in her chair; but, as
she still gazed at him, he went on,
well pleased:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>15</span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you much about California.
It was in Australia I learned
sheep-farming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, of course,&#8221; said Aggie, frigidly,
&#8220;you killed sheep, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For our own consumption&#8212;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said it a little haughtily. He
wished her to understand the difference
between a grazier and a butcher.</p>

<p>&#8220;And lambs? Little lambs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes. I&#8217;m afraid the little
lambs had to go, too, sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you? How could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I? Well, you see, I
just had to. I couldn&#8217;t shirk when
the other fellows didn&#8217;t. In time you
get not to mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I never exactly enjoyed doing
 it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But you did it. And you
didn&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>16</span>She saw him steeped in butcheries,
in the blood of little lambs, and her
tender heart revolted against him.
She tried to persuade herself that it
was the lambs she minded most; but
it was the pig she minded. There was
something so low about killing a pig.
It seemed to mark him.</p>

<p>And it was marked, stained abominably,
that he went from her presence.
He said to himself: &#8220;I&#8217;ve dished myself
now with my silly jabber. Damn
those lambs!&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Arthur Gatty, winged by
some divine intuition, called at the
Laurels the next afternoon. The gods
were good to young Arthur, they
breathed upon him the spirit of refinement
and an indestructible gentleness
that day. There was no jarring
note in him. He rang all golden to
Aggie&#8217;s testing touch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>17</span>When he had gone a great calm settled
upon her. It was all so simple
now. Nobody was left but Arthur
Gatty. She had just got to make up
her mind about <em>him</em>&#8212;which would
take a little time&#8212;and then&#8212;either
she was a happy married woman or,
said Aggie, coyly, a still happier old
maid in Queningford forever.</p>

<p>It was surprising how little the alternative
distressed her.</p>

<p>It was the last week in April, and
Mr. Gatty&#8217;s Easter holiday was
near its end. On the Monday, very
early in the morning, the young clerk
would leave Queningford for town.</p>

<p>By Friday his manner had become,
as Susie Purcell expressed it, &#8220;so
marked&#8221; that the most inexperienced
young lady could have suffered no
doubt as to the nature of his affections.
But no sooner had Aggie heard that
he was going than she had begun to
doubt, and had kept on doubting
(horribly) up to Saturday morning.
All Friday she had been bothering
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name="page19"></a>19</span>Susie. Did Susie think there was any
one in town whom he was in a hurry
to get back to? Did Susie think such
a man as Mr. Gatty could think twice
about a girl like her? Did Susie think
he only thought her a forward little
minx? Or did she think he really was
beginning to care? And Susie said:
&#8220;You goose! How do I know, if you
don&#8217;t? He hasn&#8217;t said anything to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And on Saturday morning Aggie all
but knew. For that day he asked permission
to take her for a drive, having
borrowed a trap for the purpose.</p>

<p>They drove up to a northern slope
of the Cotswolds, by a road that took
them past High Farm; and there they
found John Hurst superintending his
sheep-shearing. Aggie, regardless of
his feelings, insisted on getting out of
the trap and looking on. John talked
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>20</span>all the time to the shepherd, while
Arthur talked to Aggie, and Aggie,
cruel little Aggie, made remarks about
the hard-heartedness of shearers.</p>

<p>Arthur (&#8220;that bald-faced young
Cockney snob,&#8221; as John called him)
was depressed by the dominating presence
of his rival and his visible efficiency.
He looked long and thoughtfully
at the sheep-shearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boni pastoris est,&#8221; he observed,
&#8220;tondere oves, non deglubere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie shook her pretty head, as
much as to say Latin was beyond her;
and he was kind enough to translate.
&#8220;It is the part of a good shepherd to
shear, not flay, the sheep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that from Virgil?&#8221; she asked,
looking up into his face with a smile
of unstained intellectual innocence.</p>

<p>A terrific struggle arose in young
Arthur&#8217;s breast. If he said it was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page21" name="page21"></a>21</span>from Virgil (it was a thousand to one
against her knowing), he might leap
into her love at one high bound. If
he said he didn&#8217;t know where it came
from before it got into his Latin exercise,
he would be exactly where he
was before, which, he reflected, dismally,
was nowhere. Whereas, that
fellow Hurst was forever on the spot.</p>

<p>On the other hand, where would he
be if&#8212;if&#8212;supposing that she ever
found him out?</p>

<p>A thousand to one against it. He
who aims high must take high risks.
He took them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s Virgil.&#8221; And
he added, to clinch the matter, &#8220;From
the &#8216;Georgics.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The light in her believing eyes told
him how inspired he had been.</p>

<p>The more he thought of it the more
likely it seemed. A flash of reminiscence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>22</span>from his school-days visited him;
he remembered that Virgil did write
some things called &#8220;Georgics,&#8221; and
that Georgics were a kind of pastoral,
and that pastorals always had sheep in
them, and shepherds. It was a good
risk, anyhow, and he could see that
it was justified by success. When his
conscience reproached him for
pretending he knew more Latin than he
did, he told it that he would soon
know heaps. If all by himself, in cold
blood, and for no particular reason, he
could keep slogging away at a difficult
language evening after evening, what
couldn&#8217;t he do with Aggie&#8217;s love as
an incentive? Why, he could learn
enough Latin to read Virgil in two
months, and to teach Aggie, too.
And if any one had asked him what
good that would do either of them,
he would have replied, contemptuously,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>23</span>that some things were ends in
themselves.</p>

<p>Still, he longed to prove his quality
in some more honorable way. He
called at the Laurels again that evening
after supper. And, while Mrs.
Purcell affected to doze, and Susie, as
confidante, held Kate and Eliza well
in play, he found another moment.
With a solemnity impaired by extreme
nervousness, he asked Miss Purcell if
she would accept a copy of <i>Browning&#8217;s
Poems</i>, which he had ventured to
order for her from town. He hadn&#8217;t
brought it with him, because he wished
to multiply pretexts for calling; besides,
as he said, he didn&#8217;t know whether
she would really care&#8212;</p>

<p>Aggie cared very much, indeed, and
proved it by blushing as she said so.
She had no need now to ask Susie anything.
She knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>24</span>And yet, in spite of the Browning
and the Virgil, it was surprising how
cool and unexcited she felt in the face
of her knowledge, now she had it.
She felt&#8212;she wouldn&#8217;t have owned
it&#8212;but she felt something remarkably
like indifference. She wondered
whether she had seemed indifferent to
him (the thought gave her a pang that
she had not experienced when John
Hurst laid his heart out to be trampled
on). She wondered whether she <em>were</em>
indifferent, really. How could you
tell when you really loved a man?
She had looked for great joy and glory
and uplifting. And they hadn&#8217;t come.
It was as if she had held her heart in
her hand and looked at it, and, because
she felt no fluttering, had argued
that love had never touched it;
for she did not yet know that love&#8217;s
deepest dwelling-place is in the quiet
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>25</span>heart. Aggie had never loved before,
and she thought that she was in the
sanctuary on Saturday, when she was
only standing on the threshold, waiting
for her hour.</p>

<p>It came, all of a sudden, on the Sunday.</p>

<p>Aggie&#8217;s memory retained every detail
of that blessed day&#8212;a day of
spring sunshine, warm with the breath
of wall-flowers and violets. Arthur,
walking in the garden with her, was
so mixed up with those delicious scents
that Aggie could never smell them
afterwards without thinking of him.
A day that was not only all
wall-flowers and violets, but all Arthur.
For Arthur called first thing before
breakfast to bring her the Browning,
and first thing after breakfast to go
with her to church, and first thing after
dinner to take her for a walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>26</span>They went into the low-lying Queningford
fields beside the river. They
took the Browning with them; Arthur
carried it under his arm. In his loose,
gray overcoat and soft hat he looked
like a poet himself, or a Socialist, or
Something. He always looked like
Something. As for Aggie, she had
never looked prettier than she looked
that day. He had never known before
how big and blue her eyes were, nor
that her fawn-colored hair had soft
webs of gold all over it. She, in her
clean new clothes, was like a young
Spring herself, all blue and white and
green, dawn-rose and radiant gold.
The heart of the young man was quick
with love of her.</p>

<p>They found a sheltered place for
Aggie to sit in, while <a id="text_for_frontis"></a>Arthur lay at her
feet and read aloud to her. He read
&#8220;Abt Vogler,&#8221; &#8220;Prospice,&#8221; selections
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>27</span>from &#8220;The Death in the Desert&#8221; (the
day being Sunday); and then, with
a pause and a shy turning of the
leaves, and a great break in his
voice, &#8220;Oh, Lyric Love, Half Angel
and Half Bird,&#8221; through to the
end.</p>

<p>Their hearts beat very fast in the
silence afterwards.</p>

<p>He turned to the fly-leaf where he
had inscribed her name.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to have written something
more. May I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes. Please write anything
you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now the awful question for
young Arthur was: Whatever should
he write? &#8220;With warmest regards&#8221;
was too warm; &#8220;kind regards&#8221; were
too cold; &#8220;good wishes&#8221; sounded like
Christmas or a birthday; &#8220;remembrances&#8221;
implied that things were at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>28</span>an end instead of a beginning. All
these shades, the warmth, the reticence,
the inspired audacity, might be
indicated under the veil of verse. If
he dared&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said Aggie, &#8220;you&#8217;d write
me something of your own.&#8221; (She
knew he did it.)</p>

<p>What more could he want than that
she should divine him thus?</p>

<p>For twenty minutes (he thought
they were only seconds), young Arthur
lay flat on his stomach and brooded
over the Browning. Aggie sat quiet
as a mouse, lest the rustle of her gown
should break the divine enchantment.
At last it came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear, since you loved this book, it
is your own&#8212;&#8221; That was how it began.
Long afterwards Arthur would
turn pale when he thought of how it
went on; for it was wonderful how
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page29" name="page29"></a>29</span>bad it was, especially the lines that
<em>had</em> to rhyme.</p>

<p>He did not know it when he gave
her back the book.</p>

<p>She read it over and over again,
seeing how bad it was, and not caring.
For her the beginning, middle, and end
of that delicate lyric were in the one
word &#8220;Dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mind?&#8221; He had risen
and was standing over her as she
read.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;ve called you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up suddenly. His face
met hers, and before she knew it
Aggie&#8217;s initiation came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Arthur, rising solemn
from the consecration of the primal
kiss, and drawing himself up like
a man for the first time aware of
his full stature, &#8220;that makes <em>that</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page30" name="page30"></a>30</span>seem pretty poor stuff, doesn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Young Arthur had just looked
upon Love himself, and for that
moment his vision was purged of
vanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Browning?&#8221; asked Aggie, a
little anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8212;Not Browning. Me. Browning
could write poetry. I can&#8217;t. I
know that now.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she knew it, too; but that
made no difference. It was not for
his poetry she loved him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; said her mother, after
Arthur had stayed for tea and supper,
and said his good-bye and gone&#8212;&#8220;so
that&#8217;s the man you&#8217;ve been waiting
for all this time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the man I&#8217;ve been
waiting for,&#8221; said Aggie.</p>

<p>Three days later Queningford knew
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name="page31"></a>31</span>that Aggie was going to marry Arthur
Gatty, and that John Hurst was going
to marry Susie.</p>

<p>Susie was not pretty, but she had
eyes like Aggie&#8217;s.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="Chapter_III">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>32</span>III</h2>


<p>After all, Susie was married before
her eldest sister; for Aggie
had to wait till Arthur&#8217;s salary rose.
He thought it was going to rise at
midsummer, or if not at midsummer,
then at Michaelmas. But midsummer
and Michaelmas passed, Christmas and
Easter, too, and Arthur&#8217;s salary showed
no sign of rising. He daren&#8217;t tell Aggie
that he had been obliged to leave
off reading Latin in the evenings,
and was working feverishly at shorthand
in order to increase his efficiency.
His efficiency increased, but not his
salary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name="page33"></a>33</span>Meanwhile he spent all his holidays
at Queningford, and Aggie had been
twice to town. They saw so little of
each other that every meeting was a
divine event, a spiritual adventure.
If each was not exactly an undiscovered
country to the other, there was
always some territory left over from
last time, endlessly alluring to the pilgrim
lover. Whenever Arthur found
in Aggie&#8217;s mind a little bare spot that
needed cultivating, he planted there a
picture or a poem, that instantly took
root, and began to bloom as it had
never (to his eyes) bloomed in any
other soil. Aggie, for her part, yielded
all the treasure of her little kingdom
as tribute to the empire that had
won her.</p>

<p>Many things were uncertain, the
rise of Arthur&#8217;s salary among them;
but of one thing they were sure, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>34</span>they would lead the intellectual life
together. Whatever happened, they
would keep it up.</p>

<p>They were keeping it up as late as
August, when Arthur came down for
the Bank Holiday. He was still enthusiastic,
but uncertainty had dimmed
his hope. Marriage had become a
magnificent phantasm, superimposed
upon a dream, a purely supposititious
rise of salary. The prospect had removed
itself so far in time that it had
parted with its substance, like an object
retired modestly into space.</p>

<p>They were walking together in the
Queningford fields, when Arthur stopped
suddenly and turned to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aggie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;supposing, after
all, we can never marry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Aggie, calmly, &#8220;if we
don&#8217;t we shall still lead our real life
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>35</span>&#8220;But how, if we&#8217;re separated?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would go on just the same.
But we sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be separated. I shall
get something to do in town and live
there. I&#8217;ll be a clerk, or go into a
shop&#8212;or something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling, that would never
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it, though!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t let you do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why ever not? We should see
each other every evening, and every
Saturday and Sunday. We should
always be learning something new,
and learning it together. We should
have a heavenly time.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Arthur shook his head sadly.
&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t work, my sweetheart.
We aren&#8217;t made like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said Aggie, stoutly, and
there was silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; she said, presently,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>36</span>&#8220;whatever happens, we&#8217;re not going
to let it drop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather not,&#8221; said he, with incorruptible
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Then, just because he had left off
thinking about it, he was told that in
the autumn of that year he might
expect a rise.</p>

<p>And in the autumn they were married.</p>

<p>Aggie left the sweet gardens, the
white roads and green fields of Queningford,
to live in a side street in
Camden Town, in a creaking little
villa built of sulphurous yellow brick
furred with soot.</p>

<p>They had come back from their
brilliant fortnight on the south coast,
and were standing together in the
atrocious bow-window of their little
sitting room looking out on the
street. A thick gray rain was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>37</span>falling, and a dust-cart was in
sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aggie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll
miss the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said nothing; she was lost in
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks rather a brute of a place,
doesn&#8217;t it? But it won&#8217;t be so bad
when the rain clears off. And you
know, dear, there are the museums
and picture-galleries in town, and
there&#8217;ll be the concerts, and lectures
on all sorts of interesting subjects,
two or three times a week. Then
there&#8217;s our Debating Society at Hampstead&#8212;just
a few of us who meet together
to discuss big questions. Every
month it meets, and you&#8217;ll get to know
all the intellectual people&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie nodded her head at each exciting
item of the programme as he
reeled it off.  His heart smote him; he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name="page38"></a>38</span>felt that he hadn&#8217;t prepared her properly
for Camden Town. He thought
she was mourning the first perishing
of her illusions.</p>

<p>His voice fell, humbly. &#8220;And I
really think, in time, you know, you
won&#8217;t find it quite so bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned on him the face of one
risen rosy from the embraces of her
dream. She put a hand on each of
his shoulders, and looked at him with
shining eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Arthur, <em>dear</em>, it&#8217;s all too beautiful.
I couldn&#8217;t say anything, because
I was so happy. Come, and
let&#8217;s look at everything all over again.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they went, and looked at everything
all over again, reviving the delight
that had gone to the furnishing
of that innocent interior. She cried
out with joy over the cheap art serges,
the brown-paper backgrounds, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>39</span>blue-and-gray drugget, the oak chairs
with their rush bottoms, the Borne-Jones
photogravures, the &#8220;Hope&#8221;
and the &#8220;Love Leading Life,&#8221; and
the &#8220;Love Triumphant.&#8221; Their home
would be the home of a material poverty,
but to Aggie&#8217;s mind it was also
a shrine whose austere beauty sheltered
the priceless spiritual ideal.</p>

<p>Their wedded ardor flamed when he
showed her for the tenth time his
wonderful contrivance for multiplying
bookshelves, as their treasures accumulated
year by year. They spoke with
confidence of a day when the shelves
would reach from floor to ceiling, to
meet the inevitable expansion of the
intellectual life.</p>

<p>They went out that very evening
to a lecture on &#8220;Appearance and
Reality,&#8221; an inspiring lecture. They
lived in it again (sitting over their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>40</span>cocoa in the tiny dining-room), each
kindling the other with the same
sacred flame. She gazed with adoration
at his thin, flushed face, as, illumined
by the lecture, he developed
with excitement his theory of life.</p>


<div class="illo" id="illo_3">
	<img src="images/illo_3.jpg" width="442" height="399" alt="A man and a woman sit at a table." />
<p class="illo_caption">&#8220;Over their cocoa he developed his theory of life&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Only think,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how people
wreck their lives just because they
don&#8217;t know the difference between appearance
and reality! Now we do
know. We&#8217;re poor; but we don&#8217;t
care a rap, because we know, you and
I, that that doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s the
immaterial that matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spiritually he flamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t change with my boss,
though he&#8217;s got five thousand a year.
He&#8217;s a slave&#8212;a slave to his carriage
and horses, a slave to his house, a
slave to the office&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So are you. You work hard
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page41" name="page41"></a>41</span>&#8220;I work harder than he does. But
I keep myself detached.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some more cocoa, dearie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather. Yes, three lumps, please.
Just think what we can get out of life,
you and I, with our tiny income. We
get what we put into it&#8212;and that&#8217;s
something literally priceless, and we
mustn&#8217;t let it go. Whatever happens
we must stick to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing can take it away from
us,&#8221; said Aggie, rapt in her dream.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; no outside thing can. But,
Aggie&#8212;we can take it from each
other, if we let ourselves get slack.
Whatever we do,&#8221; he said, solemnly,
&#8220;we mustn&#8217;t get slack. We must keep
it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Aggie, &#8220;we must keep
it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had pledged themselves to
that.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="Chapter_IV">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42"></a>42</span>IV</h2>


<p>No fowler spreads his snares in
sight of those innocent birds
that perch on the tree of life in paradise.
As Arthur&#8217;s soul (it was a vain
soul) preened its wings before her,
Aggie never inquired whether the
brilliance of its plumage was its own,
or merely common to all feathered
things in the pairing season. Young
Arthur&#8217;s soul was like a lark, singing
in heaven its delirious nuptial hymn.
Aggie sat snug in her nest and marvelled
at her mate, at the mounting of
his wings, the splendid and untiring ardors
of his song. Nor was she alarmed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>43</span>at his remarkable disappearance into
the empyrean. Lost to sight he might
be, but she could count on his swift,
inevitable descent into the nest.</p>

<p>The nest itself was the most wonderful
nest a bird ever sat in. The
two were so enthusiastic over everything
that they delighted even in that
dreadful, creaking, yellow villa. Its
very vices entertained them. When
it creaked they sat still and looked at
each other, waiting for it to do it
again. No other house ever possessed
such ungovernable and mysterious
spontaneities of sound. It was sometimes,
they said, as if the villa were
alive. And when all the wood-work
shrank, and the winter winds streamed
through their sitting-room, Aggie
said nothing but put sand-bags in the
window and covered them with art
serge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name="page44"></a>44</span>Her mother declared that she had
never stayed in a more inconvenient
house; but Aggie wouldn&#8217;t hear a
word against it. It was the house
that Arthur had chosen. She was
sorry, she said, if her mother didn&#8217;t
like it. Mrs. Purcell was sorry, too,
because she could not honestly say
that, in the circumstances, she enjoyed
a visit to Aggie and her husband.
They made her quite uncomfortable,
the pair of them. Their ceaseless activities
and enthusiasms bewildered
her. She didn&#8217;t care a rap about the
lectures, and thought they were mad
to go traipsing all the way to Hampstead
to harangue about things they
could have discussed just as well&#8212;now,
couldn&#8217;t they?&#8212;at home. Aggie,
she said, would become completely
undomesticated. Mrs. Purcell
was never pressed to stay longer than
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page45" name="page45"></a>45</span>a week. They had no further need of
her, those two sublime young egoists,
fused by their fervors into one egoist,
sublimer still. Mrs. Purcell was a sad
hinderance to the intellectual life, and
they were glad when she was gone.</p>

<p>Heavens, how they kept it up!
All through the winter evenings, when
they were not going to lectures, they
were reading Browning aloud to each
other. For pure love of it, for its own
sake, they said. But did Aggie tire
on that high way, she kept it up for
Arthur&#8217;s sake; did Arthur flag, he
kept it up for hers.</p>

<p>Then, in the spring, there came a
time when Aggie couldn&#8217;t go to lectures
any more. Arthur went, and
brought her back the gist of them,
lest she should feel herself utterly cut
off. The intellectual life had, even
for him, become something of a struggle.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46"></a>46</span>But, tired as he sometimes was,
she made him go, sending, as it were,
her knight into the battle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;we shall
have to keep it up more than ever.
For <em>them</em>, you know.&#8221;</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I saw a ship a-sailing, a-sailing on the sea,</p>
<p>And it was full of pretty things for Baby and for me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Aggie always sang that song the
same way. When she sang &#8220;for
Baby&#8221; she gave the baby a little
squeeze that made him laugh; when
she sang &#8220;for me&#8221; she gave Arthur
a little look that made him smile.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There were raisins in the cabin, sugared kisses in the hold.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here the baby was kissed crescendo,
prestissimo, till he laughed more than
ever.</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>48</span>&#8220;&#8216;The sails were made of silver and the masts were made of gold.</p>
<p>The captain was a duck, and <em>he</em> cried&#8212;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Quack, quack!&#8221; said Arthur. It
was Daddy&#8217;s part in the great play,
and it made the baby nearly choke
with laughter.</p>

	<p class="illo_caption">&#8220;&#8216;Quack, quack!&#8217; said Arthur, and it made the baby nearly choke with laughter&#8221;</p>
</div>



<p>Arthur was on the floor, in a posture
of solemn adoration somewhat
out of keeping with his utterances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Baby!&#8221; cried Aggie, &#8220;what
times we&#8217;ll have when Daddy&#8217;s ship
comes home!&#8221;</p>

<p>The intellectual life had lapsed;
but only for a period. Not for a
moment could they contemplate its
entire extinction. It was to be resumed
with imperishable energy later
on; they had pledged themselves to
that. Meanwhile they had got beyond
the stage when Aggie would call
to her husband a dozen times a day:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page49" name="page49"></a>49</span>&#8220;Oh, Arthur, look! If you poke him
in the cheek like that, he&#8217;ll smile.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Arthur would poke him in the
cheek, very gently, and say: &#8220;Why, I
never! What a rum little beggar he
is! He&#8217;s got some tremendous joke
against us, you bet.&#8221;</p>

<p>And a dialogue like this would follow:
&#8220;Oh, Arthur, look, look, <em>look</em>,
at his little feet!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say&#8212;do you think you ought
to squeeze him like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he doesn&#8217;t mind. He likes it.
Doesn&#8217;t he?  My beauty&#8212;my bird!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have blue eyes, Aggie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;ll change; they always
do.  And his <em>nose</em> is just like yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wish I had his head of hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a terrible day for Arthur
when the baby&#8217;s head of hair began to
come off, till Aggie told him it always
did that, and it would grow again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name="page50"></a>50</span>To-day they were celebrating the
first birthday of the little son. At
supper that night a solemn thought
came to Aggie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Arthur, only think. On Arty&#8217;s
birthday&#8221; (they had been practising
calling him &#8220;Arty&#8221; for the last fortnight)
&#8220;he won&#8217;t be a baby any
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind; Arty&#8217;s little sister
will be having her first birthday very
soon after.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie blushed for pure joy, and
smiled. She hadn&#8217;t thought of that.
But how sad it would be for poor baby
not to be <em>the</em> baby any more!</p>

<p>Arthur gave an anxious glance at
Aggie in her evening blouse. His
mind was not set so high but what
he liked to see his pretty wife wearing
pretty gowns. And some of the money
that was to have gone to the buying
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>51</span>of books had passed over to the gay
drapers of Camden Town and Holloway.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what it means, dear?
We shall have to live more carefully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, of course I know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind?&#8221; She didn&#8217;t know what
he was talking about, but she gave
a sad, foreboding glance at the well-appointed
supper-table, where coffee
and mutton-chops had succeeded
cocoa. For Arthur had had a rise of
salary that year; and if Aggie had
a weakness, it was that she loved to
get him plenty of nice, nourishing
things to eat.</p>

<p>&#8220;We sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be able to have quite
so many nice things for supper. Shall
<em>you</em> mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t. Do you take
me for a pig?&#8221; said Arthur, gayly.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>52</span>He hadn&#8217;t thought of it in that light.
Wasn&#8217;t he always saying that it was
the immaterial that mattered? But
it had just come over him that pretty
Aggie wouldn&#8217;t have so many pretty
clothes to wear, because, of course,
whatever money they could save
must go to the buying of books and
the maintenance of the intellectual
life. For the home atmosphere was
to be part of the children&#8217;s education.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will have lots of nice things,&#8221;
said Aggie, &#8220;won&#8217;t we, when Daddy&#8217;s
ship comes home?&#8221;</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="Chapter_VI">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>53</span>VI</h2>

<p>Daddy&#8217;s ship never did come
home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quack, quack!&#8221; said Aggie, and
three shrill voices echoed her.</p>

<p>Aggie had to be the duck herself
now; for Daddy had long ago given
up his part in the spirited drama.</p>

<p>They had been married six years,
and Aggie had had six children. There
was Arty and Catty and Willie and
Dick and Emmy (the baby of the
year); and a memory like a sword in
her mother&#8217;s heart, which was all that
was left of little Barbara, who had
come after Catty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page54" name="page54"></a>54</span>It seemed as if there was not much
left of Aggie, either. Her delicate
individuality had shown signs of perishing
as the babies came, and the faster
it perished the faster they took its
place. At each coming there went
some part of pretty Aggie&#8217;s prettiness;
first the rose from her cheeks, then the
gold from her hair, till none of her
radiance was left but the blue light
of her eyes, and that was fainter.
Then, after Barbara&#8217;s death, her
strength went, too; and now, at the
end of the day she was too tired to
do anything but lie on the sofa and
let the children crawl all over her,
moaning sometimes when they trampled
deep. Then Arthur would stir
in his arm-chair and look irritably at
her. He still loved Aggie and the
children, but not their noises.</p>

<p>The evenings, once prolonged by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page55" name="page55"></a>55</span>gas-light and enthusiasm to a glorious
life, had shrank to a two hours&#8217; sitting
after supper. They never went anywhere
now. Picture-galleries and concert-halls
knew them no more. The
Debating Society at Hampstead had
long ago missed the faithful, inseparable
pair&#8212;the pair who never spoke,
who sat in the background listening
with shy, earnest faces, with innocence
that yearned, wide-eyed, after
wisdom, while it followed, with passionate
subservience, the inane. Arthur
had proved himself powerless to
keep it up. If an archangel&#8217;s trump
had announced a lecture for that evening,
it would not have roused him
from his apathy.</p>

<p>And as they never went to see anybody,
nobody ever came to see them.
The Hampstead ladies found Aggie
dull and her conversation monotonous.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name="page56"></a>56</span>It was all about Arthur and the
babies; and those ladies cared little
for Arthur, and for the babies less.
Of Aggie&#8217;s past enthusiasm they said
that it was nothing but a pose. Time
had revealed her, the sunken soul of
patience and of pathos, the beast of
burden, the sad-eyed, slow, and gray.</p>

<p>The spirit of the place, too, had
departed, leaving a decomposing and
discolored shell. The beloved yellow
villa had disclosed the worst side of
its nature. The brown wall-paper
had peeled and blistered, like an unwholesome
skin. The art serge had
faded; the drugget was dropping to
pieces, worn with many feet; the
wood-work had shrunk more than
ever, and draughts, keen as knives,
cut through the rooms and passages.
The &#8220;Hope&#8221; and the &#8220;Love Leading
Life&#8221; and the &#8220;Love Triumphant,&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page57" name="page57"></a>57</span>like imperishable frescos in a decaying
sanctuary, were pitiful survivals,
testifying to the death of dreams.</p>

<p>Saddest of all, the bookshelves, that
were to have shot up to the ceiling,
had remained three feet from the
floor, showing the abrupt arrest of the
intellectual life.</p>

<p>It was evident that they hadn&#8217;t
kept it up.</p>

<p>If anything, Arthur was more effaced,
more obliterated, than his wife.
He, whose appearance had once suggested
a remarkable personality, a
poet or a thinker, now looked what he
had become, a depressed and harassed
city clerk, no more. His face was
dragged by deep downward lines that
accentuated its weakness. A thin
wisp of colorless mustache sheltered,
without concealing, the irritability of
his mouth. Under his high, sallow
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name="page58"></a>58</span>forehead, his eyes, once so spiritual,
looked out on his surroundings with
more indifference than discontent.
His soul fretted him no longer; it
had passed beyond strenuousness to
the peace of dulness. Only the sounds
made by his wife and children had
power to agitate him.</p>

<p>He was agitated now.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; he said, looking up
from the magazine he was trying to
read, not because it interested him in
the least, but because it helped to
keep the noises out.</p>

<p>But the children were clamoring for
an encore. &#8220;Again, again!&#8221; they cried.
&#8220;Oh Mummy, <em>do</em> do it again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hsh-sh-sh. Daddy&#8217;s reading.&#8221;
And Aggie drew the children closer to
her, and went on with the rhyme in
her sad, weak whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you must read aloud to them,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name="page59"></a>59</span>for goodness&#8217; sake speak up and have
done with it. I can&#8217;t stand that
whispering.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie put down the picture-book,
and Arty seized one half and Catty
the other, and they tugged, till Catty
let go and hit Arty, and Arty hit Catty
back again, and Catty howled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you keep those children
quiet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Arty, shame! to hurt your little
sister!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that Arty howled louder than
Catty.</p>

<p>Arthur sat up in his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave the room, sir! Clear out
this instant!&#8221; His weak face looked
weaker in its inappropriate assumption
of command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear what I say, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Arty stopped crying, and steadied
his quivering infant mouth till it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page60" name="page60"></a>60</span>expressed his invincible determination.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll g-g-g-go for Mommy. But
I w-w-w-won&#8217;t go for Daddy. I
doesh&#8217;n&#8217;t &#8216;ike him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hsh-sh&#8212;poor Daddy&#8212;he&#8217;s so
tired. Run away to the nursery,
darlings, all of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think why on earth you
have them down here at this time,&#8221;
said their father, as the door slammed
behind the last retreating child.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, you said yourself it&#8217;s the
only time you have for seeing them.
I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t get much of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get a great deal too much sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we only had a big place for them
to run about in&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of talking about
things we haven&#8217;t got, and never shall
have?  Is supper ready?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>61</span>She raised herself heavily from her
sofa, and went to see, trailing an old
shawl after her. Arthur, by way of
being useful, put his foot upon the
shawl as it went by.</p>

<p>After supper he felt decidedly better,
and was inclined to talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I met Davidson this morning in
the city. He said his wife hadn&#8217;t
seen you for an age. Why don&#8217;t you
go and look her up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t expect her to be always
running after you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t run after her, I assure you.
I haven&#8217;t the strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You used,&#8221; he said, reproachfully,
&#8220;to be strong enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie&#8217;s mouth twisted into a blanched,
unhappy smile&#8212;a smile born
of wisdom and of patience and of
pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page62" name="page62"></a>62</span>&#8220;My dear, you don&#8217;t know what it
is to have had six children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t I? I know enough not
to want any more of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8212;then&#8212;&#8221; said Aggie.</p>

<p>But Arthur&#8217;s eyes evaded her imploring
and pathetic gaze. He turned
the subject back to Mrs. Davidson&#8212;a
clumsy shift.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, it doesn&#8217;t take much
strength to call on Mrs. Davidson,
does it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no good. I can&#8217;t think of anything
to say to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come, she isn&#8217;t difficult to get
on with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I am. I don&#8217;t know why
it is I always feel so stupid now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Arthur, &#8220;is because
you haven&#8217;t kept it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had the time,&#8221; she
wailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page63" name="page63"></a>63</span>&#8220;Time? Oh, rubbish, you should
make time. It doesn&#8217;t do to let
things go like that. Think of the
children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because I&#8217;m always thinking
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>They rose from their poor repast.
(Coffee and mutton-chops had vanished
from the board, and another period
of cocoa had set in.) He picked up
her shawl, that had dropped again,
and placed it about her shoulders, and
they dragged themselves mournfully
back into their sitting-room. She
took up her place on the sofa. He
dropped into the arm-chair, where
he sat motionless, looking dully at the
fire. His wife watched him with her
faded, tender eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arthur,&#8221; she said, suddenly, &#8220;it&#8217;s
the first meeting of the Society to-night.
Did you forget?&#8221; They had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name="page64"></a>64</span>never admitted, to themselves or to
each other, that they had given it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Arthur, peevishly, &#8220;of
course I forgot. How on earth did
you expect me to remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you ought to go, dear,
sometimes. You never went all last
winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a pity not to try&#8212;a little&#8212;just
to keep it up? If it&#8217;s only for
the children&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Aggie, it&#8217;s for the children&#8217;s
sake&#8212;and yours&#8212;that I fag
my brain out, as it is. When you&#8217;ve
been as hard at it as I&#8217;ve been, all
day, you don&#8217;t feel so very like turning
out again&#8212;not for that sort of
intellectual game. You say you feel
stupid in the afternoon. What do
you suppose I feel like in the evening?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page65" name="page65"></a>65</span>His accents cut Aggie to the heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear, I know. I only
thought it might do you good, sometimes,
to get a change&#8212;if it&#8217;s only
from me and my stupidity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s one thing I hate more
than another,&#8221; said Arthur, &#8220;it is a
change.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew it. That had been her
consolation. Arthur was not as the
race of dreamers to which he once
seemed to have belonged. There was
in him a dumb, undying fidelity to the
tried and chosen. From the first, before
his apathy came on him, he had
hardly ever left her to an evening by
herself. He had had neither eyes nor
ears nor voice for any other woman.
And though her face had become the
face of another woman, and he hated
changes, she knew that it had never
changed for him.  He loved her more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page66" name="page66"></a>66</span>than any of the six children she had
borne him.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; said Aggie, &#8220;do you
think it really matters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I think what matters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked suspiciously at her, his
heavy brain stirred by some foreboding
of uncomfortable suggestion; she
had been thinking of Barbara, perhaps.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t. The flame in the woman&#8217;s
heart was not wholly dead, because
he had kindled it, and it was
one with her love of him. The dream
they had dreamed together had lived
on for her; first, as an agony, then as
a regret. But the man had passed
over into the sensual darkness that is
seldom pierced by pain. Of the pleasures
that had once borne him, buoyant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page67" name="page67"></a>67</span>and triumphant, on the crest of
the wave, none were left but such sad
earthly wreckage as life flings up at
the ebbing of the spiritual tide.</p>

<p>They had come to the dark shores,
where, if the captain wavers, the ships
of dream founder with all their freight.</p>

<p>A dull light was already kindling
under his tired eyelids.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what <em>you</em> feel like,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve had enough sitting-up
for one night. Don&#8217;t you think
you&#8217;d better go to bed?&#8221;</p>

<p>She went, obediently.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="Chapter_VII">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page68" name="page68"></a>68</span>VII</h2>
<p>A year passed. It was winter
again, and the Gattys had had
sickness in their house. Aggie had
been ailing ever since the birth of the
baby that had succeeded Emmy.
And one evening the doctor had to
be summoned for little Willie, who
had croup. Willie, not four years old,
was the last baby but three. Yes, he
was only a baby himself; Aggie realized
it with anguish, as she undressed
him and he lay convulsed on her lap.
He was only a baby; and she had left
him to run about with Arty and
Catty as if he were a big boy. She
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page69" name="page69"></a>69</span>should have taken more care of
Willie.</p>

<p>But the gods took care of Willie,
and he was better before the doctor
could arrive; and Aggie got all the
credit of his cure.</p>

<p>Aggie couldn&#8217;t believe it. She was
convinced the doctor was keeping
something from her, he sat so long
with Arthur in the dining-room. She
could hear their voices booming up
the chimney as she mended the fire in
the nursery overhead. It was not,
she argued, as if he ever cared to talk
to Arthur. Nobody ever cared to
talk to Arthur long, nor did he care
to talk to anybody.</p>

<p>So, when the clock struck seven
(the doctor&#8217;s dinner-hour), and the
dining-room door never opened, Aggie&#8217;s
anxiety became terror, and she
stole down-stairs.  She had meant to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page70" name="page70"></a>70</span>go boldly in, and not stand there listening;
but she caught one emphatic
word that arrested her, and held her
there, intent, afraid of her own terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221;</p>

<p>She could hear Arthur&#8217;s weak voice
sharpened to a falsetto, as if he, too,
were terrified.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, never. Never any more!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a note almost of judgment
in the doctor&#8217;s voice; but Aggie
could not hear that, for the wild cry
that went up in her heart. &#8220;Oh,
never what? Is Willie&#8212;my Willie&#8212;never
to be well any more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she listened without a scruple,
justified by her motherhood. They
were keeping things from her, as they
had kept them before. As they had
kept them when little Barbara sickened.</p>

<p class="illo_caption">&#8220;She listened without a scruple, justified by her motherhood&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;And if&#8212;if&#8212;&#8221;  Arthur&#8217;s voice was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page71" name="page71"></a>71</span>weaker this time; it had a sort of
moral powerlessness in it; but Aggie&#8217;s
straining ears caught the &#8220;if.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There mustn&#8217;t be any &#8216;ifs.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie&#8217;s heart struggled in the
clutches of her fright.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not what I mean. I mean&#8212;is
there any danger now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From what I can gather so far, I
should say&#8212;none.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie&#8217;s heart gave a great bound of
recovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if,&#8221; the doctor went on, &#8220;as
you say&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know&#8221; cried Arthur, &#8220;you
needn&#8217;t say it. You won&#8217;t answer for
the consequences?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t. For the consequences, a
woman&#8212;in the weak state your wife
is in&#8212;may answer herself&#8212;with her
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie was immensely relieved. So
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72"></a>72</span>they were only talking about her all
the time!</p>

<p>That night her husband told her
that her release had come. It had
been ordained that she was to rest for
two years. And she was to have help.
They must have a girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arthur,&#8221; she said, firmly, &#8220;I
won&#8217;t have a girl. They&#8217;re worse than
charwomen. They eat more; and we
can&#8217;t afford it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We <em>must</em> afford it. And oh, another
thing&#8212;Have you ever thought
of the children&#8217;s education?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thought of it? She had thought of
nothing else, lying awake at night,
waiting for the baby&#8217;s cry; sitting in
the daytime, stitching at the small garments
that were always just too small.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she said, submissively.
She was willing to yield the glory of the
idea to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page73" name="page73"></a>73</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how
we&#8217;re going to manage it. One thing
I do know&#8212;there mustn&#8217;t be any more
of them.  I can&#8217;t afford it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had said that before so often
that Aggie had felt inclined to tell
him that she couldn&#8217;t afford it, either.
But to-night she was silent, for he
didn&#8217;t know she knew. And as she saw
that he (who did know) was trying to
spare her, she blessed him in her heart.</p>

<p>If he did not tell her everything
that the doctor had said, he told her
that Willie was all right. Willie had
been declared to be a child of powerful
health. They weren&#8217;t to coddle
him. As if any one <em>had</em> coddled him!
Poor Aggie only wished she had the
time.</p>

<p>But now that her release had come,
she would have time, and strength,
too, for many things that she had had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page74" name="page74"></a>74</span>to leave undone. She would get nearer
to her children, and to her husband,
too. Even at four o&#8217;clock in the
morning, Aggie had joy in spite of her
mortal weariness, as she rocked the
sleepless baby on the sad breast that
had never suckled him. She told the
baby all about it, because she couldn&#8217;t
keep it in.</p>

<p>&#8220;My beauty,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;he
will always be my baby. He sha&#8217;n&#8217;t
have any little brothers or sisters,
never any more. There&#8212;there&#8212;there,
did they&#8212;? Hsh-sh-sh, my sweet pet,
my lamb. My little king&#8212;he shall
never be dethroned. Hush, hush, my
treasure, or he&#8217;ll wake his poor Daddy,
he will.&#8221;</p>

<p>In another room, on his sleepless
pillow, the baby&#8217;s father turned and
groaned.</p>

<p>All the next day, and the next,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page75" name="page75"></a>75</span>Aggie went about with a light step,
and with eyes that brightened like a
bride&#8217;s, because of the spring of new
love in her heart.</p>

<p>It came over her now how right
Arthur had been, how she ought to
have kept it up, and how fearfully she
had let it go.</p>

<p>Not only the lectures&#8212;what did
they matter?&#8212;but her reading, her
music, everything, all the little arts
and refinements by which she
had once captured Arthur&#8217;s heart&#8212;&#8220;Things,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;that made all
the difference to Arthur.&#8221; How forbearing
and constant he had been!</p>

<p>That evening she dressed her hair
and put flowers on the supper-table.
Arthur opened his eyes at the unusual
appearance, but said nothing. She
could see that he was cross about
something&#8212;something that had occurred
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page76" name="page76"></a>76</span>in the office, probably. She
had never grudged him his outbursts
of irritability. It was his only dissipation.
Aggie had always congratulated
herself on being married to a
good man.</p>

<p>Coffee, the beloved luxury they had
so long renounced, was served with
that supper. But neither of them
drank it. Arthur said he wasn&#8217;t going
to be kept awake two nights running,
and after that, Aggie&#8217;s heart was too
sore to eat or drink anything. He
commented bitterly on the waste.
He said he wondered how on earth
they were going to pay the doctor&#8217;s
bills, at that rate.</p>

<p>Aggie pondered. He had lain awake
all night thinking of the doctor&#8217;s bills,
had he? And yet that was just what
they were to have no more of. Anyhow,
he had been kept awake; and,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page77" name="page77"></a>77</span>of course, that was enough to make
him irritable.</p>

<p>So Aggie thought she would soothe
him to sleep. She remembered how
he used to go to sleep sometimes in
the evenings when she played. And
the music, she reflected with her bitterness,
would cost nothing.</p>

<p>But music, good music, costs more
than anything; and Arthur was fastidious.
Aggie&#8217;s fingers had grown
stiff, and their touch had lost its tenderness.
Of their old tricks they remembered
nothing, except to stumble
at a &#8220;stretchy&#8221; chord, a perfect bullfinch
of a chord, bristling with &#8220;accidentals,&#8221;
where in their youth they
had been apt to shy. Arthur groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord, there won&#8217;t be a wink
of sleep for either of us if you wake
that brat again. What on earth possesses
you to strum?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page78" name="page78"></a>78</span>But Aggie was bent, just for the old
love of it, and for a little obstinacy, on
conquering that chord.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, stop it!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you find something better to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Aggie, trying to keep
her mouth from working, &#8220;perhaps I
could find something.&#8221;</p>

<p>Arthur looked up at her from under
his eyebrows, and was ashamed.</p>

<p>She thought still of what she could
do for him; and an inspiration came.
He had always loved to listen to her
reading. Her voice had not suffered
as her fingers had; and there, in its
old place on the shelf, was the Browning
he had given her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like me to read to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you&#8217;re not too
tired.&#8221; He was touched by the face
he had seen, and by her pathetic efforts;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page79" name="page79"></a>79</span>but oh, he thought, if she would
only understand.</p>

<p>She seated herself in the old place
opposite him, and read from where
the book fell open of its own accord.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8220;&#8216;O, lyric Love, half angel and half bird&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Her voice came stammering like a
child&#8217;s, choked with tenderness and
many memories&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And all a wonder and a wild desire&#8212;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>&#8220;Oh no, I say, for Heaven&#8217;s sake,
Aggie, not that rot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8212;you used to like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I dare say, years ago. I can&#8217;t
stand it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t stand it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he was softened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t understand it, perhaps, my
dear. But it comes to the same thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page80" name="page80"></a>80</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Aggie, &#8220;it comes to the
same thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she read no more. For the
first time, for many years, she understood
him.</p>

<p>That night, as they parted, he did
not draw her to him and kiss her;
but he let her tired head lean towards
him, and stroked her hair. Her eyes
filled with tears. She laid her forehead
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Aggie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;poor little
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her head suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s poor you,&#8221; she whispered,
&#8220;poor, poor dear.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter" id="Chapter_VIII">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page81" name="page81"></a>81</span>VIII</h2>

<p>&#8220;Now, isn&#8217;t it a pity for you to
be going, dearie? When the
place is doing you so much good, and
Susie back in another week, and all.&#8221;</p>

<div class="illo" id="illo_6">
<img src="images/illo_6.jpg" width="447" height="685" alt="A woman packs a suitcase, while two toddlers 'help' and an older woman looks on." />
<p class="illo_caption">&#8220;&#8216;Now, isn&#8217;t it a pity for you to be going, dearie?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Aggie folded up a child&#8217;s frock with
great deliberation, and pressed it,
gently but firmly, into the portmanteau.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go,&#8221; she said, gravely.
&#8220;Arthur wants me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Purcell was looking on with
unfeigned grief at her daughter&#8217;s preparations
for departure. Aggie had
gone down to Queningford, not for a
flying visit, but to spend the greater
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name="page82"></a>82</span>part of the autumn. She and Arthur
had had to abandon some of the arrangements
they had planned together;
and, though he had still insisted
in general terms on Aggie&#8217;s two
years&#8217; rest, the details had been left
to her. Thus it happened that a year
of the rest-cure had hardly rolled by
before Aggie had broken down, in a
way that had filled them both with
the gravest anxieties for the future.
For if she broke down when she was
resting, what would she do when the
two years were up and things had to
be more or less as they were before?
Aggie was so frightened this time that
she was glad to be packed off to her
mother, with Willie and Dick and
Emmy and the baby. The &#8220;girls,&#8221;
Kate and Eliza, had looked after them,
while Aggie lay back in the warm lap of
luxury, and rested for once in her life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>83</span>All Aggie&#8217;s visits had ended in the
same way. The same letter from
home, the same firm and simple statement:
&#8220;Arthur wants me. I must go,&#8221;
and Aggie was gone before they had
had a look at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;John and Susie will be quite offended.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it. Arthur comes before
John and Susie, and he wants me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had always been proud of that&#8212;his
wanting her; his inability to do
without her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what he
<em>will</em> have done without me all this
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mother looked at her sharply,
a look that, though outwardly concentrated
on Aggie, suggested much
inward criticism of Aggie&#8217;s husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must learn to do without you,&#8221;
she said, severely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>84</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I want him to,&#8221;
said Aggie, and smiled.</p>

<p>Her mother submitted with a heavy
heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;if you
had married John Hurst we shouldn&#8217;t
have <em>had</em> to say good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have taken him from
Susie for the world,&#8221; said Aggie, grimly.
She knew that her mother had
never liked poor Arthur. This knowledge
prevented her from being sufficiently
grateful to John for always
leaving his trap (the trap that was
once to have been hers) at her disposal.
It was waiting to take her to
the station now.</p>

<p>Aggie had only seen her sister, Mrs.
John Hurst, once since they had both
married. Whenever Aggie was in
Queningford, John and Susie were in
Switzerland, on the honeymoon that,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page85" name="page85"></a>85</span>for the happy, prosperous couple, renewed
itself every year.</p>

<p>This year it was agreed that, when
the Hursts came up to Islington for
the Grand Horse-Show in the spring,
they were to be put up at the Gattys&#8217;
in Camden Town.</p>

<p>Aggie was excited and a little alarmed
at the prospect of this visit. Susie
was accustomed to having everything
very nice and comfortable about her,
and she would be critical of the villa
and its ways. And, then, it would be
awkward seeing John. She smiled.
It always had been awkward seeing
John.</p>

<p>But when the spring came a new
terror was added to Aggie&#8217;s hospitable
anxiety, a new embarrassment to the
general awkwardness of seeing John.</p>

<p>After all, the Hursts put up at a
hotel in town.  But Susie was to come
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page86" name="page86"></a>86</span>over for tea and a long talk with Aggie,
John following later.</p>

<p>Aggie prepared with many tremors
for the meeting with her sister.  She
made herself quite sick and faint in
her long battling with her hair.  She
had so little time for &#8220;doing&#8221; it that
it had become very difficult to &#8220;do&#8221;
and when it was &#8220;done&#8221; she said to
herself that it looked abominable. Her
fingers shook as they strained at the
hooks of the shabby gown that was
her &#8220;best.&#8221;  She had found somewhere
a muslin  scarf that, knotted
and twined with desperate ingenuity,
produced something of the effect that
she desired.</p>

<p>Up-stairs in the nursery, Catty, very
wise for six years old, was minding the
baby, while the little nervous maid
got tea ready. Aggie sat in the drawing-room
waiting for her sister.  Even
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>87</span>as she waited she dared not be idle.
There was an old coat of Arthur&#8217;s
that she had been lining, taking advantage
of a change to milder weather;
it was warmer than the one he was
wearing, and she was afraid to let it
go another day lest the wind should
turn round to the northeast again.
In such anxieties Aggie moved and
had her being. For the rest, she had
given the little maid a lesson in the
proper way of showing Mrs. John
Hurst into the room when she arrived.</p>

<p>Mrs. John Hurst arrived a little late.
She came in unannounced (for her appearance
had taken the little maid&#8217;s
breath away); she came with a certain
rustle and sweep which was much
more important than anything Susie
had ever done in the old days when
Aggie was the pretty one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page88" name="page88"></a>88</span>Aggie was moved at seeing her. She
uttered a cry of affection and delight,
and gave herself to Susie&#8217;s open arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling!&#8221; said Mrs. John Hurst.
&#8220;Let me have a good look at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She kissed her violently, held her at
arm&#8217;s-length for a moment, and then
kissed her again, very gently. In that
moment Aggie had looked at Susie,
and Susie at Aggie, each trying to master
the meaning of the other&#8217;s face.
It was Susie who understood first.
Prosperity was very becoming to
Susie. She was the pretty one now,
and she knew it. Marriage had done
for her what maidenhood had done for
her sister, and Susie was the image
of what Aggie used to be.</p>

<p>But Aggie herself! Nothing was
left now of the diminutive distinction
that had caused her to be once adored
in Queningford.  Susie was young at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page89" name="page89"></a>89</span>two-and-thirty, and Aggie, not three
years older, was middle-aged. Not
that there were many wrinkles on
Aggie&#8217;s face. Only a deep, crescent
line on each side of a mouth that looked
as if it had been strained tight with
many tortures. It was as if Nature
had conceived a grudge against Aggie,
and strove, through maternity, to
stamp out her features as an individual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; said Aggie, to break the
intolerable tension of that look, &#8220;it&#8217;s
one of your old ones, turned and
trimmed to make it look different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor darling,&#8221; said Susie; but
what she thought was that it did look
different.</p>

<p>Luckily Mrs. John Hurst was full
of the Horse-Show. She could talk
of nothing else. It was the Horse-Show
that had made her late. She
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page90" name="page90"></a>90</span>had waited for the judging. John
would look in as soon as he could get
away. Gownboy had carried off the
gold cup and the gold medal again,
and the judges had been unjust, as
usual, to John (John, grown prosperous,
had added horse-breeding to sheep-farming.)
Ladslove had only been
highly commended. Ladslove was
Rosemary&#8217;s foal.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember Rosemary, Aggie?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie remembered neither Rosemary
nor her foal. But she was sorry for
Ladslove. She was grateful to him,
too, for holding Susie&#8217;s attention and
diverting it from all the things she
didn&#8217;t want her to see. She was
afraid of Susie; afraid of her sympathy;
afraid of her saying something
about Barbara (<em>she</em> couldn&#8217;t
speak of little Bessie, Susie&#8217;s only
child, who had died three years ago).
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page91" name="page91"></a>91</span>Above all, she was afraid of Susie&#8217;s
inquisitive tongue and searching eyes.</p>

<p>She flung herself into fictitious
reminiscences of the Queningford stud.
She couldn&#8217;t have done worse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aggie,&#8221; said her sister, &#8220;you
<em>do</em> mix them up so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said poor Aggie, &#8220;there are
so many of them, I can&#8217;t keep count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, dear.&#8221; Aggie&#8217;s words
recalled Susie to her sisterly duties.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t asked after the children
yet. How many are there? <em>I</em> can&#8217;t
keep count, either, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie turned away, found the old
coat she had been lining, and spread
it on her lap. Susie&#8217;s eye roamed and
rested on the coat, and Aggie&#8217;s followed
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do excuse my going on with this.
Arthur wants it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Susie smiled in recognition of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page92" name="page92"></a>92</span>familiar phrase. Ever since he had
first appeared in Queningford, Arthur
had always been wanting something.
But, as she looked at the poor coat,
she reflected that one thing he had
never wanted, or had never asked for,
and that was help.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aggie,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I do hope that
if you ever want a little help, dear,
you&#8217;ll come to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Susie, preoccupied with the idea of
liberality, could not see that she had
chosen her moment badly. Her offer,
going as it did, hand-in-hand with her
glance, reflected upon Arthur.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any help, thank you,&#8221;
said Aggie. &#8220;Arthur&#8217;s doing very
well now.  Very well, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Susie, &#8220;why on earth
do you break your back over that
stitching, if there&#8217;s no need? That&#8217;s
not my notion of economy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page93" name="page93"></a>93</span>Susie was a kind-hearted woman,
but eight years of solid comfort and
prosperity had blunted her perceptions.
Moreover, she had an earnestly practical
mind, a mind for which material
considerations outweighed every other.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Susie, your notion of
economy would be the same as mine,
if you had had seven children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; said Susie, sadly.
She was humbled by the rebuff she
had just received. &#8220;I only wish I
had.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie looked up from her work with
a remorseful tenderness in her tired
eyes. She was sorry for poor Susie,
who had lost her only one.</p>

<p>But Susie had already regretted her
momentary weakness, and her pride
was up. She was a primitive woman,
and had always feared lest reproach
should lie upon her among the mothers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>94</span>of many children. Besides, she had
never forgotten that her John had
loved Aggie first. Aggie, with her
seven children, should not set her
down as a woman slighted by her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had the strength for it,&#8221;
said she; and Aggie winced. &#8220;The
doctor told John I mustn&#8217;t have more
than the one. And I haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Aggie hardened her face before
Susie&#8217;s eyes, for she felt that they were
spying out and judging her. And
Susie, seeing that set look, remembered
how badly Aggie had once behaved
to her John. Therefore she was
tempted to extol him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But then,&#8221; said she, magnificently,
&#8220;I have my husband.&#8221; (As if
Aggie hadn&#8217;t hers!) &#8220;Nobody knows
what John is but me. Do you know,
there hasn&#8217;t been one unkind word
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page95" name="page95"></a>95</span>passed between us, nor one cross look,
ever since he married me eight years
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are very few who can say
that.&#8221; Aggie tried to throw a ring
of robust congratulation into her flat
tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very few. But there&#8217;s no one
like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one like you, either, I should
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, for him there isn&#8217;t. He&#8217;s
never had eyes for any one but me&#8212;never.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie cast down her eyes demurely
at that. She had no desire to hurt
Susie by reminding her of the facts.
But Susie, being sensitive on the subject,
had provided for all that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, dear, I know, just at
first, he thought of you. A fancy.
He told me all about it; and how you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page96" name="page96"></a>96</span>wouldn&#8217;t have him, <em>he</em> said. He said
he didn&#8217;t think you thought him gentle
enough. That shows how much
you knew about him, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should always have supposed,&#8221;
said Aggie, coldly, &#8220;he would be gentle
to any one he cared for.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew, and Susie knew, she had
supposed the very opposite; but she
wished Susie to understand that John
had been rejected with full realization
of his virtues, because, good as he was,
somebody else was still better. So
that there might be no suspicion of
regret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentle? Why, Aggie, if that was
what you wanted, he&#8217;s as gentle as a
woman. Gentler&#8212;there aren&#8217;t many
women, I can tell you, who have the
strength that goes with that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie bent her head lower yet over
her work. She thought she could see
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page97" name="page97"></a>97</span>in Susie&#8217;s speech a vindictive and critical
intention. All the time she had,
Aggie thought, been choosing her
words judicially, so that each unnecessary
eulogy of John should strike at
some weak spot in poor Arthur. She
felt that Susie was not above paying
off her John&#8217;s old scores by an oblique
and cowardly blow at the man who
had supplanted him. She wished that
Susie would either leave off talking
about John, or go.</p>

<p>But Susie still interpreted Aggie&#8217;s
looks as a challenge, and the hymn
of praise swelled on.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear&#8212;if John wasn&#8217;t an angel
of goodness and unselfishness&#8212;When
I think how useless I am to him, and
of all that he has done for me, and all
that he has given up&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie was trembling. She drew up
the coat to shelter her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page98" name="page98"></a>98</span>&#8220;&#8212;why it makes my blood boil to
think that any one should know him,
and not know what he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aggie dropped the coat in her agitation.
As she stooped to pick it up,
Susie put out an anxious arm to help
her.</p>

<p>Their eyes met.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aggie, dear&#8212;&#8221; said Susie. It
was all she <em>could</em> say. And her
voice had in it consternation and reproach.</p>

<p>But Aggie faced her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she said, steadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing&#8212;&#8221; It was Susie&#8217;s
turn for confusion. &#8220;Only you said&#8212;and
we thought&#8212;after what you&#8217;ve
been told&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was I told?&#8221;</p>

<p>Horror  overcame  Susie,  and  she
lost her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you told, then?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page99" name="page99"></a>99</span>Her horror was reflected in her sister&#8217;s
eyes. But Aggie kept calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Susie&#8221; she said, &#8220;what do you
mean? That I wasn&#8217;t told of the
risk? Is that what you meant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aggie&#8212;&#8221; Susie was helpless.
She could not say what she had meant,
nor whether she had really meant it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who <em>should</em> be told if I wasn&#8217;t?
Surely I was the proper person?&#8221;</p>

<p>Susie recovered herself. &#8220;Of course,
dear, of course you were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Aggie forced the word
again through her tight, strained lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not blaming you, Aggie, dear.
I know it isn&#8217;t your fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose is it, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Susie&#8217;s soft face hardened, and she
said nothing.</p>

<p>Her silence lay between them; silence
that had in it a throbbing heart
of things unutterable; silence that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>100</span>was an accusation, a judgment of the
man that Aggie loved.</p>

<p>Then Aggie turned, and in her immortal
loyalty she lied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never told him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never told him? Oh, my dear,
you were very wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I? He was ill. It
would have worried him. It worried
me less to keep it to myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&#8212;the risk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Aggie, sublimely, &#8220;we
all take it. Some of us don&#8217;t know.
I did. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath of relief and
satisfaction. For four months, ever
since she had known that some such
scene as this must come, she had
known that she would meet it this
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think I hear
the children.&#8221;</p>


</div>

<div class="chapter" id="Chapter_IX">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>101</span>IX</h2>
<p>They came in, a pathetic little
procession, three golden-haired
couples, holding one another&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>First, Arty and Emmy, then Catty
and Baby, then Willie and Dick, all
solemn and shy. Baby turned his
back on the strange aunt and burrowed
into his mother&#8217;s lap. They were all
silent but Dick. Dick wanted to
know if his Auntie liked birfdays, and
if people gave her fings on her birfday&#8212;pausing
to simulate a delicate
irrelevance before he announced that
<em>his</em> birfday was to-morrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dickie, dear,&#8221; said his mother,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>102</span>nervously, &#8220;we don&#8217;t talk about our
birthdays before they&#8217;ve come.&#8221;</p>

<p>She could not bear Susie to be able
to say that one of her children had
given so gross a hint.</p>

<p>The children pressed round her, and
her hands were soon at their proud
and anxious work: coaxing stray curls
into their place; proving the strength
of the little arms; slipping a sock, to
show the marbled rose of the round
limbs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just feel Emmy&#8217;s legs. She&#8217;s as
firm as firm. And look at Baby, how
beautifully he&#8217;s made. They&#8217;re all
healthy. There isn&#8217;t an unsweet, unsound
spot in one of them.&#8221;</p>

<div class="illo" id="illo_7">
<img src="images/illo_7.jpg" width="446" height="546" alt="A woman sits surrounded by 6 small children, while another woman looks on." />
<p class="illo_caption">&#8220;&#8216;There isn&#8217;t an unsweet, unsound spot in one of them&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;No, no, they look it. They&#8217;re
magnificent. And they&#8217;re you all
over again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barbara wasn&#8217;t. She was the very
image of her father.&#8221;  Her love of him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>103</span>conquered the stubborn silence of her
grief, so that she did not shrink from
the beloved name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Susie,&#8221; she said, when the little
procession had, at its own petition,
filed solemnly out again, &#8220;you can&#8217;t
say you&#8217;ve seen too much of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Susie smiled sadly as she looked at
the wreck that was poor Aggie. &#8220;No,
my dear; but I haven&#8217;t seen quite
enough of you. There isn&#8217;t much left
of you, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; She paused, and then broke
out again, triumphant in her justification:
&#8220;No matter if there&#8217;s nothing
left of me. <em>They&#8217;re</em> alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised her head. Worn out and
broken down she might be, but she
was the mother of superb children.
Something stronger and more beautiful
than her lost youth flamed in her
as she vindicated her motherhood.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>104</span>She struck even Susie&#8217;s dull imagination
as wonderful.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Aggie bent her
aching back again over her work.
She had turned a stiff, set face to
Susie as she parted from her. John
had come and gone, and it had not
been awkward in the least. He was
kind and courteous (time and prosperity
had improved him), but he had,
as Susie said, no eyes for any one but
his wife.</p>

<p>As Aggie worked she was assailed
by many thoughts and many memories.
Out of the past there rose a sublime
and patient face. It smiled at her
above a butchery of little lambs.</p>

<p>Yes, Susie was right about her John.
There was no weak spot in him. He
had not a great intellect, but he had
a great heart and a great will. Aggie
remembered how once, in her thoughtful
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>105</span>maiden days, she had read in one
of the vicar&#8217;s books a saying which
had struck her at the time, for the
vicar had underlined it twice. &#8220;If
there is aught spiritual in man, it is
the Will.&#8221; She had not thought of
John as a very spiritual person. She
had dimly divined in him the possibility
of strong passions, such passions
as make shipwreck of men&#8217;s
lives. And here was Arthur&#8212;he, poor
dear, would never be shipwrecked, for
he hadn&#8217;t one strong passion in him;
he had only a few weak little impulses,
incessantly frustrating a will
weaker than them all. She remembered
how her little undeveloped soul,
with its flutterings and strugglings
after the immaterial, had been repelled
by the large presence of the
natural man. It had been afraid to
trust itself to his strength, lest its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>106</span>wings should suffer for it. It had not
been afraid to trust itself to Arthur;
and his weakness had made it a wingless
thing, dragged down by the suffering
of her body.</p>

<p>She said to herself, &#8220;If I had known
John was like that&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped her brain before it
could answer for her! &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t
be sitting here now stitching at that
coat.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stitched on till she could see to
stitch no more; for tears came and
blinded her eyes, and fell upon the
coat.</p>

<p>That was just after she had kissed
it.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="Chapter_X">
<h2><span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>107</span>X</h2>
<p>It was Easter, three weeks after
Susie&#8217;s visit; and Arthur was going
away for a fortnight, his first real
holiday in seven years. For some
time he had been lengthening out his
office hours, and increasing his salary,
by adding night to day. And now he
had worn himself out by his own
ferocious industry. He knew, and
Aggie knew, that he was in for a bad
illness if he didn&#8217;t get away, and at
once. He had written in his extremity
to a bachelor brother, known in the
little house at Camden Town as the
Mammon of Unrighteousness. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>108</span>brother had a big house down in Kent;
and into that house, though it was the
house of Mammon, Arthur proposed
that he should be received for a week
or two. He took care to mention,
casually, and by way of a jest after
the brother&#8217;s own heart, that for those
weeks he, Arthur, would be a lonely
widower.</p>

<p>The brother was in the habit of remembering
Arthur&#8217;s existence once a
year at Christmas. He would have
had him down often enough, he said,
if the poor beggar could have come
alone. But he barred Aggie and the
children. Aggie, poor dear, was a
bore; and the children, six, by Jove
(or was it seven?), were just seven (or
was it six?) blanked nuisances. Though
uncertain about the number of the
children, he always sent seven or eight
presents at Christmas to be on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>109</span>safe side. So when Arthur announced
that he was a widower, the brother,
in his bachelor home, gave a great roar
of genial laughter. He saw an opportunity
of paying off all his debts to
Arthur in a comparatively easy fashion
all at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take him for a fortnight, poor
devil? I&#8217;d take him for ten fortnights.
Heavens, what a relief it must
be to get away from &#8216;Aggie&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>And when Arthur got his brother&#8217;s
letter, he and Aggie were quite sorry
that they had ever called him the
Mammon of Unrighteousness.</p>

<p>But the brother kept good company
down in Kent. Aggie knew that, in
the old abominable Queningford phrase,
he was &#8220;in with the county.&#8221; She
saw her Arthur mixing in gay garden
scenes, with a cruel spring sun shining
on the shabby suit that had seen so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>110</span>many springs. Arthur&#8217;s heart failed
him at the last moment, but Aggie
did not fail. Go he must, she said.
If the brother was the Mammon of
Unrighteousness, all the more, she argued,
should he be propitiated&#8212;for the
children&#8217;s sake. (The Mammon was
too selfish ever to marry, and there
were no other nieces and nephews.)
She represented the going down into
Kent as a sublime act of self-sacrifice
by which Arthur, as it were, consecrated
his paternity. She sustained
that lofty note till Arthur himself was
struck with his own sublimity. And
when she told him to stand up and let
her look at him, he stood up, tired as
he was, and let her look at him.</p>

<p>Many sheepfolds have delivered up
their blameless flocks to Mammon.
But Aggie, when she considered the
quality of the god, felt dimly that no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>111</span>more innocent victim was ever yet
provided than poor, jaded Arthur in
his suit of other years. The thought
in her mind was that it would not do
for him to look <em>too</em> innocent. He
must go&#8212;but not like that.</p>

<p>So, for three days of blinding labor,
Aggie applied herself to the propitiation
of Mammon, the sending forth of
her sacrificial lamb properly decked
for the sacrifice. There never had
been such a hauling and overhauling
of clothes, such folding and unfolding,
such stitching and darning and cleansing
and pressing, such dragging out
and packing of heavy portmanteaus,
such a getting up of shirts that should
be irreproachable.</p>

<p>Aggie did it all herself; she would
trust no one, least of all the laundress.
She had only faint old visions of John
Hurst&#8217;s collars to guide her; but she
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>112</span>was upheld by an immense relief, born
of her will to please, and Arthur, by
a blind reliance, born of his utter weariness.
At times these preparations well-nigh
exasperated him. &#8220;If going meant
all that fuss,&#8221; he said, &#8220;he&#8217;d rather
not go.&#8221; But if he had been told that
anything would happen to prevent his
going, he would have sat down and
cursed or cried. His nerves clamored
for change now&#8212;any change from the
office and the horrible yellow villa in
Camden Town.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, at the critical moment,
Aggie&#8217;s energy showed signs of
slowing down, and it seemed to both
of them that she would never get him
off.</p>

<p>Then, for the first time, he woke to
a dreary interest in the packing. He
began to think of things for himself.
He thought of a certain suit of flannels
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>113</span>which he must take with him, which
Aggie hadn&#8217;t cleaned or mended, either.
In his weak state, it seemed to him
that his very going depended on that
suit of flannels. He went about the
house inquiring irritably for them.
He didn&#8217;t know that his voice had
grown so fierce in its quality that it
scared the children; or that he was
ordering Aggie about like a dog; or
that he was putting upon her bowed
and patient back burdens heavier than
it should have borne. He didn&#8217;t know
what he was doing.</p>

<p>And he did not know why Aggie&#8217;s
brain was so dull and her feet so slow,
nor why her hands, that were incessantly
doing, seemed now incapable
of doing any one thing right. He did
not know, because he was stupefied
with his own miserable sensations, and
Aggie had contrived to hide from him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>114</span>what Susie&#8217;s sharp eyes had discovered.
Besides, he felt that, in his officially
invalid capacity, a certain license was
permitted him.</p>

<p>So, when he found his flannels in the
boot cupboard, he came and flung
them onto the table where Aggie bent
over her ironing-board. A feeble fury
shook him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody but a fool,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;would ram good flannels into a
filthy boot cupboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Aggie, in a strange,
uninterested voice. &#8220;You must have
put them there yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He remembered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, placably, for he
was, after all, a just man, &#8220;do you
think they could be made a little
cleaner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;can&#8217;t&#8212;&#8221; said Aggie, in a still
stranger voice, a voice that sounded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>115</span>as if it were deflected somehow by
her bent body and came from another
woman rather far away. It
made Arthur turn in the doorway and
look at her. She rose, straightening
herself slowly, dragging herself upward
from the table with both hands. Her
bleached lips parted; she drew in her
breath with a quick sound like a sob,
and let it out again on a sharp note of
pain.</p>

<p>He rushed to her, all his sunken
manhood roused by her bitter, helpless
cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aggie, darling, what is it? Are
you ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I&#8217;m not ill; I&#8217;m only tired,&#8221;
she sobbed, clutching at him with her
two hands, and swaying where she
stood.</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and half
dragged, half carried her from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>116</span>room. On the narrow stairs they
paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go alone,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>She tried to free herself from his
grasp, failed, and laid her head back
on his shoulder again; and he lifted
her and carried her to her bed.</p>

<p>He knelt down and took off her
shoes. He sat beside her, supporting
her while he let down her long, thin
braids of hair. She looked up at him,
and saw that there was still no knowledge
in the frightened eyes that gazed
at her; and when he would have unfastened
the bodice of her gown, she
pushed back his hands and held them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she whimpered. &#8220;Go
away.  Go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aggie&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away, I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God,&#8221; he moaned, more smitten,
more helpless than she.  For, as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>117</span>she turned from him, he understood
the height and depth of her tender
perjury. She had meant to spare him
for as long as it might be, because,
afterwards (she must have felt), his
own conscience would not be so merciful.</p>

<p>He undressed her, handling her with
his clumsy gentleness, and laid her in
her bed.</p>

<p>He had called the maid; she went
bustling to and fro, loud-footed and
wild-eyed. From time to time a cry
came from the nursery where the little
ones were left alone. Outside,
down the street, Arty and Catty ran
hand-in-hand to fetch the doctor, their
sobbing checked by a mastering sense
of their service and importance.</p>

<p>And the man, more helpless than
any child, clung to the woman&#8217;s hand
and waited with her for her hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>118</span>As he waited he looked round the
shabby room, and saw for the first
time how poor a place it was. Nothing
seemed to have been provided for
Aggie; nothing ever was provided for
her; she was always providing things
for other people. His eyes fastened
on the Madonna di Gran Duca fading
in her frame. He remembered how
he had bought it for Aggie seven years
ago. Aggie lay under the Madonna,
with her eyes closed, making believe
that she slept. But he could see by
the fluttering of her eyelids that her
spirit was awake and restless.</p>

<p>Presently she spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arthur,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I believe I&#8217;m
going to have a nice quiet night, after
all. But when&#8212;when the time comes,
you&#8217;re not to worry, do you hear?
Kate and mother will come up and
look after me.  And you&#8217;re to go away
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name="page119"></a>119</span>to-morrow, just as if nothing had happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;The flannels,&#8221; she said, &#8220;shall be
washed and sent after you. You&#8217;re
not to worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was providing still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aggie&#8212;darling&#8212;don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? <em>You</em> ought to go to
bed, because you&#8217;ll have to get up so
early to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>She closed her eyes, and he watched
and waited through minutes that were
hours. It seemed to him that it was
another man than he who waited and
watched. He was estranged from his
former self, the virtuous, laborious self
that he had once known, moving in its
dull and desolate routine. Thoughts
came to him, terrible, abominable
thoughts that could never have occurred to it.</p>


<div class="illo" id="illo_8">

<p class="illo_caption">&#8220;Thoughts came to him, terrible thoughts&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>120</span>&#8220;It would have been better,&#8221; said
this new self, &#8220;if I had been unfaithful
to her. <em>That</em> wouldn&#8217;t have
killed her.&#8221;</p>

<p>As if she had heard him through
some spiritual sense, she pressed his
hand and answered him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God,&#8221; she whispered, hoarsely,
&#8220;that you&#8217;ve always loved me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She struggled with her voice for a
moment; then it came, brave and
clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Arthur. I wrote to mother
three weeks ago. About this. I&#8217;ve
made her think that it was I who
wanted the children, always, from the
very first. She&#8217;ll understand that I
couldn&#8217;t be happy without a baby in
my arms. It <em>is</em> different. They&#8217;re
never quite the same after the first
year. Even Arty wasn&#8217;t. Mother will
understand.  She won&#8217;t be hard.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>121</span>She had provided for everything. It
was her lie that proved the extremity
of her fear, her foreboding.</p>

<p>If only she had not lied!</p>

<p>Somehow, in the seven years of his
married life, he had never seen this
calamity in front of him. His dreams
had always been of a time when their
children should be out in the world,
when he saw himself walking with his
wife in some quiet country place, like
Queningford.</p>

<p>If she had not lied!</p>

<p>He sought for calm words wherewith
to support her; but no words came.
He clutched at the bedclothes. His
eyes were blind with tears, his ears
deafened by the sound of his own
pulses.</p>

<p>In a moment the seven years were
unveiled. He had a sudden vision of
Aggie&#8217;s incorruptible love and divine
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>122</span>tenderness before his grief closed over
him.</p>

<p>Her eyes were resting upon his.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid,&#8221; she said; &#8220;not
the least little bit. I&#8217;d rather you
went away to-morrow. I don&#8217;t&#8212;mind&#8212;being
left.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when to-morrow came it was
he who was left.</p>

<p>He was sitting in the room underneath
Aggie&#8217;s. He had a pen in his
hand, and his mind was unusually
calm and clear. He had just telegraphed
to his brother that he couldn&#8217;t
go&#8212;because Aggie was dead. Now he
was trying to write to Aggie&#8217;s mother
to tell her to come&#8212;because Aggie was
dead.</p>

<p>He had a great many things to see
to&#8212;because Aggie was dead.</p>

<p>All at once he raised his head; he
listened; he started up with a groan
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>123</span>that was a cry, and went from the
room.</p>

<p>Up-stairs in the nursery a child&#8217;s
voice was singing:</p>


<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>&#8220;&#8216;I saw a ship a-sailing, a-sailing on the sea.</p>
		<p>And it was full of pretty things&#8212;for Baby&#8212;and for me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
